# Recipe Widgets

A simple HTML and CSS project that creates expandable recipe cards without using any JavaScript.

## What's This About?

This project demonstrates how to create interactive recipe widgets using only HTML and CSS. The widgets can expand and collapse to show more or fewer ingredients/instructions, all without a single line of JavaScript.

## What You'll Find

- **Recipe Card with Checkboxes**: A meat lasagna recipe with ingredient checkboxes that you can check off as you cook
- **Recipe Card with Text**: The same recipe but with cooking instructions in paragraph form

Both cards start collapsed (showing only 10 items) and can be expanded to show everything. Pretty neat, right?

## How It Works

The magic happens with CSS and hidden checkboxes. When you click "Show more", it actually toggles a hidden checkbox that CSS uses to show or hide the extra content. No JavaScript wizardry needed!


## Files

- `index.html` - The main page with both recipe widgets
- `styles.css` - All the styling and show/hide functionality

That's it! Simple, clean, and functional.
